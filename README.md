# Examination System With Project ASP.NET MVC 

The main purpose of the project is to enable students to take their exams online and teachers to make exams online for their students. So we have two types of users which the user chooses during the registration.

### Teacher:
1. Add, Update and Delete Subject.
2. Add, Update and Delete Exams For Each Subject.

### Student:
1. Enroll into Subjects.
2. Take Subjects Exams.
